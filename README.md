## GraphQL

The objective of this project is to learn the GraphQL query language, by creating my own profile page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## The page is hosted on: https://kvlahe.github.io/graphql
